# Win My Argument

Win My Argument is an AI-powered tool designed to provide credible, research-backed references during discussions or debates. When you make a statement like "according to studies" in an argument, this tool helps you back it up by scraping and referencing actual research abstracts from trusted sources like **arXiv.org**. Instead of relying on generic forum posts or unverified data, it taps into real academic studies to provide robust, contextually relevant evidence to support your point.

By using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, Win My Argument can process a wide range of academic abstracts and generate concise, relevant citations based on the user's query. Whether you're defending your stance in an argument or simply looking for reliable references, this system empowers you with data-driven insights directly from scholarly papers, offering more authoritative and precise references than traditional online searches.
